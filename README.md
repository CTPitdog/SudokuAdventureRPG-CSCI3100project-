# SudokuAdventureRPG(CSCI3100project)
 Many members of 2024/25 CSCI3100 group A6 are mathematics majors, and we aim to demonstrate that math is not just for the academically inclined; it can also be fascinating and enjoyable. To share the entertaining aspects of mathematics with the public, we are creating a Sudoku RPG.
